# Code Description:
    # This Python script provides a menu-driven interface to manage chemical inventory. 
    # It allows users to add, view, dispose, restock chemicals, and execute experiments. 
    # Chemical details are stored in a dictionary. Users can save and load the inventory from a file.

# Import the inventory management system module
